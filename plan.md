## TO BE COMPLETED/FIXED/UPDATED

### :dart: Temperature & Units Today

- [ ] Fix alignment of units (ok in browsers, not on mobile)

- [x] Styling of units upon click (C in darker colour | F in lighter colour > Temp displayed is in C). How to change CSS styling from JS? > SOLVED by adding the class active and adding/removing the class via JS

- [x] Behaviour unit conversion when using geolocator (test different scenarios) > SOLVED by positioning the global variable 'celsiusTemperature'

- [ ] Fix colour when hovering over the C/F units, is set to blue?

- [ ] Current location button not working on safari/iphone (works fine in Chrome)

### :dart: Search Bar

- [ ] Clearing search bar and default back to placeholder after search is performed

- [ ] Add CSS ease-in-out when hovering over search bar

### :dart: Weather Icons (API) & Search Engine

TBD

### :dart: 5 Day Forecast

TBD

### :dart: Graphics

- [ ] Create own weather icons? > to match condition codes of Weather API (https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions#Weather-Condition-Codes-2)
